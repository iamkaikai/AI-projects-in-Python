# Minimax - depth 3
After implementing Minimax with a depth of 3, the AI's behavior improved significantly, showing a clear strategy for targeting the opponent's high-value pieces like Queen or Rook. However, when the depth is shallow, the AI tends to rely heavily on a single knight and three pawns throughout the game. Additionally, I observed that the Minimax AI struggles to deliver a checkmate when the opponent is left with only a king, a situation that should be relatively straightforward to resolve.
