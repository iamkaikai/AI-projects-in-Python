# AI Projects in Python

## Overview
This repository showcases a collection of AI projects implemented in Python. It demonstrates a wide range of skills and knowledge in traditional artificial intelligence, problem modeling, and algorithmic solutions.

## Projects

### [Chess AI](https://github.com/iamkaikai/AI-projects-in-Python/tree/main/chess)
- Implementation of a depth-limited Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and Iterative Deepening. Extensions include Zobrist hashing, moves ordering, and advanced evaluation.

### [Sudoku](https://github.com/iamkaikai/AI-projects-in-Python/tree/main/sudoku)
- Analyzing and implementing SAT solving algorithms (GSAT, walkSAT, DPLL) for solving Sudoku puzzles.

### [Mazeworld](https://github.com/iamkaikai/AI-projects-in-Python/tree/main/mazeworld)
- Pathfinding in ASCII mazes using A* and Uniform-Cost-Search algorithms, including multi-robot coordination and a blind robot variant.

### [Circuit Board Layout Arangement](https://github.com/iamkaikai/AI-projects-in-Python/tree/main/CPS)
- A solver for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) using heuristics and inference techniques like MRV, LCV, and AC-3.

### [Foxes and Chickens](https://github.com/iamkaikai/AI-projects-in-Python/tree/main/foxes%20and%20chicken)
- Algorithms to solve the “missionaries and cannibals” problem variant with a focus on safe river crossing for chickens and foxes.

### [Localization in a Maze world](https://github.com/iamkaikai/AI-projects-in-Python/tree/main/HHM)
- Estimating a robot's position in a maze using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), with probabilistic filtering and sensory input analysis.

### [PRM-Based Motion Planning for Planar Robot Arms](https://github.com/iamkaikai/AI-projects-in-Python/tree/main/Robot%20motion%20planning)
- Implementing a Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) for motion planning in planar robot arms in environments with obstacles.
